\section{Demo Plans}
For this demonstration, our team plans to showcase the core functionalities of our application.
This will build on top of the POC, and this time, it will showcase the application's functionality with a clear \textbf{User Interface}. 
These functionalities include user authentication, data processing, a matchmaking algorithm, and other core features that set the basis of the rideshare application.
The demonstration will involve a live walkthrough of the application functionalities. For instance, we will run a quick scenario in which a user
signs up/logs in, selects their user type (driver or rider), and shows their respective functionalities like matchmaking, trip management, reporting, and cost estimation. Finally, the demonstration will also include a 
brief overview of the admin dashboard, which aims to handle user management, safety reports, and user/trip analytics. 
Overall, this demonstration will highlight the progress that has been made since the POC and demonstrate a user-friendly interface that is ready to enter its user testing phase.
