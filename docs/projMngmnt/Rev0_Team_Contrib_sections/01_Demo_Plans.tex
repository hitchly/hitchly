\section{Demo Plans}

The Revision 0 demonstration will showcase a comprehensive, production-ready version of the Hitchly application with enhanced features beyond the Proof of Concept. Building upon the POC's foundation of McMaster email authentication and basic ride matching, the Rev 0 demo will demonstrate a complete end-to-end user experience with expanded functionality.

        \item Real-time match notifications
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Route \& Trip Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trip creation with origin, destination, departure time, and capacity
        \item Visual route representation using mapping services
        \item Trip lifecycle management (scheduled, active, completed states)
        \item Trip cancellation and modification capabilities
        \item Seat management and capacity tracking
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Scheduling System}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recurring schedule creation (weekly patterns, day-of-week selection)
        \item Automated trip generation from recurring schedules
        \item One-time schedule support
        \item Schedule viewing and cancellation
        \item Integration with trip creation for seamless ride planning
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Cost Calculation \& Trip Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complex fare calculation based on gas costs, number of passengers, and parking fees
        \item Per-passenger cost breakdown
        \item Trip confirmation workflow
        \item Ride check-in system (start and end of trip)
        \item Trip summary generation with detailed cost breakdown
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Safety \& Reporting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User reporting system for safety incidents
        \item Safety resources and information pages
        \item Report submission and tracking
        \item Safety flag management
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Admin \& Moderation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Admin dashboard for platform oversight
        \item User management and role assignment
        \item Report review and resolution workflow
        \item User warning and moderation actions
        \item Application analytics and statistics
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User Experience Enhancements}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Polished mobile UI using NativeWind and shadcn/ui components
        \item Smooth navigation between screens
        \item Push notifications for matches and trip updates
        \item Rating and review system for completed trips
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demo Workflow}

The demonstration will follow a complete user journey:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Driver Onboarding:} Show a driver signing up, verifying their McMaster email, registering their vehicle, and setting their schedule and cost preferences.
    
    \item \textbf{Rider Onboarding:} Demonstrate a rider creating their profile, inputting their schedule and location preferences, and setting matching filters.
    
    \item \textbf{Recurring Schedule Setup:} Demonstrate creating a recurring weekly schedule (e.g., Monday-Friday morning commute) that automatically generates trips, showing how the Scheduling Module integrates with trip creation.
    
    \item \textbf{Trip Creation \& Route Visualization:} Show a driver creating a trip with origin and destination, displaying the route on a map, and setting capacity. Demonstrate both one-time trips and trips generated from recurring schedules.
    
    \item \textbf{Matching Process:} Show the system matching multiple riders with a driver based on overlapping schedules, compatible locations, and user preferences. Display the matching algorithm's results and cost estimates.
    
    \item \textbf{Trip Confirmation:} Demonstrate the confirmation workflow where both driver and riders accept the match, leading to a confirmed trip.
    
    \item \textbf{Trip Execution:} Show the ride check-in process at the start and end of the trip, demonstrating real-time trip tracking.
    
    \item \textbf{Trip Completion:} Display the generated trip summary with detailed cost breakdown per passenger, and demonstrate the rating/review system.
    
    \item \textbf{Safety \& Reporting:} Demonstrate the safety reporting feature where a user can submit a report about another user or safety concern, showing the report submission workflow.
    
    \item \textbf{Admin Dashboard (Optional):} If time permits, briefly demonstrate the admin dashboard showing user management, report review, and application analytics capabilities.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Technical Demonstration}

The demo will also highlight the technical robustness of the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-platform functionality (iOS and Android)
    \item Responsive UI and smooth user interactions
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive demonstration will validate that Hitchly has evolved from a proof-of-concept into a functional, user-ready application that addresses the core problem of safe, affordable, and sustainable commuting for the McMaster community.
