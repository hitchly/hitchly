\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The system can be divided into the following components:

\subsection{Authentication System}
This component allows users to verify themselves as McMaster students and
 to log in to the system in order to access the application features.

\subsection{Profile System}
This component allows users to input relevant personal information such 
as their schedule, GPS location, and role (Driver or Passenger).

\subsection{Matching System}
This component uses backend logic to pair users based on their schedule, location, 
and preferences.

\subsection{Cost Calculation System}
This component calculates the total trip cost for the driver and creates 
a per-rider estimate that factors in gas, parking, and other related expenses.

\subsection{Database}
This component stores user details, ride requests, matches, historical 
data, and any other relevant information required by the system.

\subsection{Ratings and Review System}
This component allows users to rate each other after completing their 
trips and to add reviews to their profiles.


\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
