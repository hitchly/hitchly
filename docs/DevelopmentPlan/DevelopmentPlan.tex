\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

Our team will use several platforms for communication to stay as organized and connected as possible.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Github:} This will be the central platform for code collaboration and project task management. 
	\begin{itemize}
    \item The team will use Issues to log tasks and meetings, and to assign responsibilities.
    \item Project boards will be used to help track the team's progress throughout the project.
  \end{itemize}
  \item {\bf Discord:} This will be used as the primary communication platform for the team. 
        Meetings will take place in the Discord server, as well as any other quick communication, updates, and questions.
  \item {\bf Microsoft Teams:} Teams will also be used to share files and documents to stay organized.
  \item {\bf Outlook:} Email will be used to communicate with the Professor, TA, and any other external inquiries related to the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Member Roles}

The roles outlined below will guide the workflow of the team and ensure key responsibilities are covered, but remain flexible to allow all members to rotate respinsibilities
and step in for each other as we progress through the project, allowing each member to get experience in a number of areas. While all members of the team
will be required to contribute to development, doocumentation, and other general tasks of the project, certain criticial aspects of the project that require 
domain expertise and consistent oversight will have designated leads. The leads ensure that these areas are managed properly and provides direction and accountability for all team members.
This approach to team member roles helps balance shared learning with the need for leadership.
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Meeting Chair:} This person will be responsible for taking lead of any group meetings by setting an agenda and ensuring
        everybody is on the same page by taking notes of what was discussed. They will also be responsible for taking notes during TA meetings
        and coordinating any other meetings that need to take place.
  \item {\bf Reviewer:} Reviews any pull requests and commits for documentation to ensure that the content aligns with the rest of the group's work, 
        and also fits the "Exceeds" criteria on the rubric. Feedback will be provided as appropriate to improve the quality of work submitted.
  \item {\bf Testing lead:} In charge of overseeing the creation and execution of test plans, which can include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure features meet the requirements and functionality is stable. 
  \item {\bf UI/UX Lead:} Specializes in understanding user needs and designing and refining the interface of the application. Conducts usability tests
        and gathers feedback to ensure the design is user-friendly. 
  \item {\bf Data Management and Insights Lead:} Responsible for overseeing how data which is required for the application is being stored and managed
        in the app's database and schemas, and how it is integrated into the application. Also responsible for tracking key metrics such as the number of rides,
        estimated carbon footprint reduction, etc.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

% What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
% demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
% you will be able to overcome this risk?

The primary risks for this project are user trust and safety and the reliability of the ride-matching system.
Without a secure verification process tied to McMaster email accounts, users may hesitate to adopt the platform.
Similarly, if the matching algorithm fails to correctly pair riders and drivers based on schedules and locations, the application will not provide value.
The proof of concept will focus on validating these two core capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{McMaster Email Verification}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Users must sign up using a McMaster-affiliated email.
      \item Verification ensures that only students, staff, and faculty can access the platform.
      \item Demonstrates credibility and mitigates safety concerns for early users.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Ride Matching Prototype}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item A minimal matching engine takes sample schedules and trip data from riders and drivers.
      \item Produces correct pairings with cost-sharing estimates.
      \item Confirms feasibility of integrating timetable and location-based logic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

By validating these areas first, the team ensures the platform addresses its two biggest risks of safety and usability before expanding into additional features such as live tracking, queuing, or ratings.


\section{Expected Technology}

% \wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
% libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
% the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
% libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
% learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

% \wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
% of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
% it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
% choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
% implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
% project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
% members will need to augment their training.}

% Topics to discuss include the following:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Specific programming language
% \item Specific libraries
% \item Pre-trained models
% \item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
% \item Specific unit testing framework
% \item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
% \item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
%   is not being done
% \item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
%   appropriate
% \item Tools you will likely be using?
% \end{itemize}

% \wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

    \item Pull requests with mandatory peer review before merging.
    \item All commits to main branch must be squashed and merged (enforced via GitHub rulesets).
    \item Descriptive commit messages using Conventional Commits format.
    \item GitHub Projects for issue tracking, milestones, and labeling (bug, feature, documentation, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Testing Practices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests for core features (authentication, ride matching).
