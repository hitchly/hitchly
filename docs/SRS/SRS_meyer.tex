\section{(G) Goals}
\subsection*{Reading Guide}
Goals are ``needs of the target organization, which the system will address''. While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders \cite{meyer2022}. It must contain enough information to provide---if read just by itself---a general sketch of the entire project. To this effect, chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system and G.1 will typically include some key properties of the environment. As it addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of specialized technical terms. Together, G.1, G.2 and G.3 describe the rationale for the project. It is important to state these justifications explicitly. Typically, they are well understood at the start of the project, but management and priorities can change \cite{meyer2022}.

\subsection{(G.1) Context and Overall Objectives}
Commuting to McMaster University presents significant financial and environmental challenges. Students, staff, and faculty spend between 150 and 250 dollars monthly on fuel, parking, or transit, which places an economic burden on them. At the same time, single-occupancy vehicles contribute to 36 percent of greenhouse gas emissions for Canadian universities, harming both local air quality and broader sustainability goals. Existing ridesharing solutions such as Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji, or Poparide do not provide sufficient verification or security, leaving users at risk of riding with unaffiliated strangers. The objective of Hitchly is to provide a safe, affordable, and reliable ridesharing platform tailored for the McMaster community. By verifying users through McMaster email accounts, Hitchly ensures trust, reduces costs, supports sustainability, and helps the university meet its long-term community and environmental goals. 

\subsection{(G.2) Current Situation}
Currently, McMaster commuters lack a centralized, trusted platform to connect drivers and riders within the university community. Those who rely on driving face steep monthly costs for gas and parking, while those taking transit encounter expensive or unreliable services. Informal ridesharing options exist, but they provide limited safety features and lack institutional alignment, making them unsuitable for building long-term trust. Students and staff often feel that available solutions are unsafe, inefficient, or financially burdensome. Hitchly seeks to fill this gap by providing a McMaster-specific application that facilitates secure ridesharing, reduces commuting costs, and lowers emissions. 

\subsection{(G.3) Expected Benefits}
The pilot delivers clear, stakeholder-visible outcomes. Riders should see more affordable commutes (targeting approximately 20\% savings) while drivers receive meaningful cost offsets (around 40\%). We aim for reliable availability ($\geq$70\% ride-fill and $\geq$95\% on-time) so trips feel predictable from day one, with most new users completing a first ride within a week. The pilot targets a reduction in single-occupancy trips on campus and nearby (aiming for at least 10\%), easing parking pressure and congestion and reducing emissions. The service will be inclusive by default (targeting about 90\% match on stated accessibility preferences) and trusted through university-verified identities with a goal of very low incident rates. The university benefits from higher student satisfaction and sense of belonging, improved commuter equity, and better alignment with sustainability reporting---while maintaining privacy safeguards (goal: zero critical incidents). Broader community outcomes include cleaner air, calmer peak traffic, and greater participation in transit and shared mobility.

  \caption{Hitchly Use Case Diagram.}
  \label{fig:ride-matching}
\end{figure}

\subsection{(G.6) Limitations and Exclusions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item McMaster-Only Access: Hitchly will only be available to McMaster students, staff, and faculty during the pilot phase. Users must verify their identity through a McMaster email. This restriction ensures trust and control but limits the platform’s reach to a single institution. 

  \item Background and Insurance Checks: For the pilot phase, Hitchly will not perform in-depth background checks or validate driver insurance. Verification is limited to McMaster email zn d driver license authentication. This keeps onboarding simple but places responsibility on users to ensure their own compliance with driving regulations.

  \item Limited Route Flexibility: Hitchly will not provide dynamic routing or live GPS tracking during the pilot. Riders and drivers must coordinate based on general pickup and drop-off locations. This simplifies the system but may limit convenience compared to fully featured ridesharing platforms. 
\end{itemize}
