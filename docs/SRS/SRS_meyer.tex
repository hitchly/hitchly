% ---------- (G) Goals ----------
\section{(G) Goals}
\subsection*{Reading Guide}
Goals are ``needs of the target organization, which the system will address''. While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders \cite{meyer2022}. It must contain enough information to provide---if read just by itself---a general sketch of the entire project. To this effect, chapter G.3 presents a short overview of the system and G.1 will typically include some key properties of the environment. As it addresses a wide readership, it should be clear and minimize the use of specialized technical terms. Together, G.1, G.2 and G.3 describe the rationale for the project. It is important to state these justifications explicitly. Typically, they are well understood at the start of the project, but management and priorities can change \cite{meyer2022}.

\subsection{(G.1) Context and Overall Objectives}
High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system. It explains why the project is needed, recalls the business context, and presents the general business objectives \cite{meyer2022}.

New university students trying to make connections with each other can often find it difficult due to the limited interactions they have outside of their program. \textit{HammerCorp Inc.} will address this by developing a web and mobile app called \textbf{ACME Connect}, which connects students based on similar interests or experiences, as well as student clubs or institutional activities. It aims to improve the overall university experience by creating a tightly-knit student community where integration of official activities happens at the student level. With safety as a primary goal, this project plans to be available to universities across North America, with a pilot program starting at McMaster University.

\subsection{(G.2) Current Situation}
Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system. It describes the current situation upon which the system is expected to improve \cite{meyer2022}.

At the moment, students are limited to in-person connections within their program or at Welcome Week events, which are often not sufficient for engagement and networking. Residence and international students may feel disconnected in a new place. Student clubs and associations also find it difficult to engage potential members. Although there are in-person events for new students and club booths around campus, those are temporary pop-ups and may not reach everyone. There is no central place for everyone to connect outside those events. Discord servers exist; however, they are often not institutionally based, which can compromise safety and allow complete strangers not affiliated with the school. Looking at these challenges, \textbf{ACME Connect} plans to address them and create a safe environment for students and institutions to foster lasting relationships throughout the university journey.

\subsection{(G.3) Expected Benefits}
New processes, or improvements to existing processes, made possible by the project’s results. It presents the business benefits expected from successful execution of the project. This chapter is the core of the Goals book, describing what the organization expects from the system \cite{meyer2022}.

\subsection{(G.4) Functionality Overview}
Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book). A capsule version of book S that enables readers to get a quick grasp of what the system will do \cite{meyer2022}.

\textit{Nothing available at this point.}

\subsection{(G.5) High-level Usage Scenarios}
Fundamental usage paths through the system, stated in user terms and independent of the system’s structure. Detailed usage scenarios appear in the System book (S.4) \cite{meyer2022}.

Elements and properties of the environment that the system will affect \cite{meyer2022}. Effects of the application include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Improved student belonging and wellbeing:} The application fosters safe and supportive environments that help students feel less isolated and more connected during the transition to university.
  \item \textbf{Increased participation in campus life:} By lowering barriers to joining clubs, events, and residence activities, the app encourages higher engagement with student associations and university-led initiatives.
  \item \textbf{Enhanced student retention and success:} With better access to support networks and resources, students are less likely to drop out due to isolation or lack of integration.
\end{itemize}
