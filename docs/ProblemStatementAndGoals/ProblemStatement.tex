\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}

The process of commuting to and from university presents numerous 
challenges. The major challenges include the 
increasing cost of fuel, GO bus fares, and the high 
cost of parking near the university premises. 
An average student and university staff/faculty 
member ends up paying more than 
\$150/month to \$250/month just on transportation ~\citep{ChandaAndSo2025}.
These not only put a financial strain on them but also 
add an emotional burden. This money could be well spent somewhere else. 
An example could be their home loans or their housing rent. 
They usually have to be very conservative on their leisure spending to save for these high transportation costs.
Moreover, the impact 
of commuters commuting to universities with their 
personal vehicles leave a significant impact on 
the environment. Universities Canada`s 2024 
footprint report states that \textbf{single occupancy} vehicle commuting contributed to around 
36\% of overall GHG emissions ~\citep{Kebirungi2024}
The air quality significantly drops due to the pollusion caused by these emmisions, which negatively affects people`s health.
To tackle these problems, commuters choose 
to carpool. However, even these bring new 
challenges. Applications like Kijiji, 
Facebook Marketplace, Poparide provide a 
solution to this problem; however, they come 
with minimal safety measures. These applications 
have drivers coming from all sorts of backgrounds 
with minimal verifications. They lack a centralized 
verification system to track driver`s details and background. 
\textbf{Hitchly} is an application that aims to make the process of commuting to McMaster 
University and back home, streamlined, affordable and safe for its users, and 
sustainable for the environment. 

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\subsubsection{Inputs}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{User data:} The user adds their personal information, commute details, university email, timetable and their location.
\item \textbf{Driver Data:} The drivers specifically add their vehicle and license details in the app. They also add their cost estimation of fuel and parking into the app.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Outputs}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{User data:} Hitchly will match users (drivers and riders) based on their schedule and location. The app will also output a summary of the trip upon completion.
\item \textbf{Driver Data:} Hitchly will generate a price estimate for the driver to decide the price per rider for a trip.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Direct Stakeholders}
The main direct stakeholders are \textbf{McMaster students} and \textbf{McMaster staff} and \textbf{faculty members}. They commute to the university and home frequently for studies and work and often look for opportunities to save and earn extra money. They can use this application to either provide a rideshare service as drivers or use those services as riders.  

\subsubsection{Indirect Stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{McMaster University:} The university will see a reduction in the congestion of traffic near its premises because of the application`s carpooling services.
\item \textbf{Hamilton Community and McMaster University Neighborhood:} The area will see a lot less congestion due to the reduction of cars. Moreover, it will also see a significant reduction in GHG emissions.  
\item \textbf{Student and Staff Families:} They will have a sense of relief and peace of mind for their carpooling family members due to the increased reliability and credibility of the ride sharing app. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Environment}
This application will be compatible on all mobile devices. It will also be supported by the two major operating systems, Android and IOS. GitHub will be used for version controlling and VS Code will be used for coding and developing the application.

\section{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Incentive for Drivers}\\ 
Students always have a tight budget incurring costs coming from tuition fees, internet bills, food expenses etc. This app gives an opportunity to students and faculty and staff members to generate an extra source of income by carpooling services. They often drive to university anyways for work or studies. This goal can be measured by how much profit a user generates per trip.  

\item \textbf{Reliable Platform to Match Riders} \\
Users often find it difficult to find a safe and reliable platform that connects drivers with users to carpool based on their location and timetable. Each user will input their timetable information, and the system will automatically recommend users with matching timetables. This will reduce the time required to search for riders with a similar schedule. This goal can be measured by the number of riders matched in a given period. It can also be measured by the number of trips users make in a given period. Lastly, the reliability of the application could be measured by the success of the McMaster affiliated email verification step during account registration.

\item \textbf{Increase Affordability} \\
Carpooling creates an opportunity for users to share the cost of commuting to and from university. This can significantly help users to manage their finances and help them save their money. This goal can be measured by comparing the monthly cost of carpooling with the average monthly cost of commuting.

\item \textbf{Improve Sustainability and Reduce Traffic Congestion} \\
This app allows users to commute in one vehicle which reduces the overall number of vehicles used to commute to and from university. A reduction of cars would also result in a significantly lower contribution towards GHG emissions. This will also result in less congestion near the university premises and thus reduce commuting delays due to traffic congestion.  This goal can be measured by estimating the emissions contributed per trip in a given period.  

\item \textbf{Ratings & Reviews System} \\
As an extension to the application, riders will be able to rate their drivers and add reviews to their profile. This will help riders make informed decisions when choosing their drivers. Additionally, this will give riders an incentive to interact more with the riders and act appropriately to receive good reviews and ratings. This will help them build their credibility within the application. This goal can be measured by checking the number of reviews and ratings for a given driver. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
