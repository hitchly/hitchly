\section{Extras} 

To enhance the scope of the project, we would like to implement the following extra
activities:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Manual: This extra will allow for user-friendly documentation guiding them 
through our application.
\item Usability Testing: This extra will allow us to test the application in the environment
it was designed for, allowing us to observe the true usability/safety/sustainability of the application.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    Our team chose a project that was well suited for all of our background skills 
    through a brief period of discovery. We all were able to connect rather early before
    the group formation deadline, and this was a major factor in our success. Another important
    factor for our success was our ability to align our interests. In a group of five people, it
    can be difficult to pick a project that aligns with our interests, however we followed a voting 
    structure and ensured everyone had a chance to voice their opinions. The discovery phase for our 
    project allowed for a swift transition to our deliverable as we were able to finalize details early 
    on and focus more time on our research phase.
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    Since our project was an idea that we came up with on our own, we did not have the benefit of having a supervisor 
    who can relay critical information to us during the research phase. However, this just meant we had the oppurtunity
    to dive deeper into the project through speaking to stakeholders around campus. Alongside that, we ensured to utilize our time 
    with the TA to ask as many questions as possible thus ensuring success in this deliverable.
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
    Adjusting the scope of our goals to ensure they were suitable for a Capstone project was supported by the help of our professor. During 
    the approval phase, we had a continous communication line with the professor to ensure we could incorporate his feedback. Through this, 
    and discussions within the team about technical skillset, we were able to come up with appropriate goals for the project.
